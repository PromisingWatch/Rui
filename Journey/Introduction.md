# What is This?
This is a minimalistic Tui toolkit. It is written completely in Rust. It has ZERO external dependencies {except for the stdlib :)}. This is a newbie made project so it might have some shitty code and rookie mistakes and I would love any feedback you have that isn't 'Get Gud' . I am documenting this as I go along so that I can record where I mess up. This is off the cuff I am not going to make a proper script for this so don't blame me if this is scuffed as hell. Also since this is an educational project so I will not use any LLM to generate code. Any code you see will be either from my dome or an online source which is not google Gemini answers.

# The Roadmap
These is my current road map:
1. Learn Terminal basics like clearing the screen.
2. Learn to capture and deal with each key press.
3. Building a minimalistic rendering engine.
4. Small UI framework on top of the renderer.
5. Making and handling Event loop and State Management.
